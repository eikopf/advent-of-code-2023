# Advent of Code 2023
> In which I write stupid code to complete easy problems in unnecessarily complex ways.

## Usage
All the solutions use the same `argh` interface (defined in the `aoc` crate), so running a solution just looks like this:

```sh
# run the solution to day 7 question 2
cat data/day7.txt | cargo run -p day7 -- --question 2

# run the solution to day 3 question 1
cat data/day3.txt | cargo run -p day3 -- -q 1
```
